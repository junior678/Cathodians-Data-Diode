Hey Cathodians

This is the readme file for useful information about our project.

Please add more info as you see necessary.

I am writing this python program in python3 so make sure you have that downloaded into your OS.

Our raspberrys will have the correct version so it should be good.

The idea of this repository is so we can add the different files to our project and have a log of the different changes that we have done as well as the documentation.

The initial python program that I have uploaded is just a simple program that starts udp cast, I will continue to work on it this week but if you guys can also contribute to the program it would be great. I know that this program might not run on windows or mac but they will run on our raspberrys.
